Coreftp.exe is the executable file for Core FTP LE, a file transfer client developed by Core FTP, designed to facilitate secure and efficient file transfers over FTP, SFTP, and FTPS protocols. The application, known for its user-friendly interface and robust feature set, has gained popularity among users needing to manage files on remote servers. As of version 2.2.1941.0, Core FTP LE is generally considered safe to use; however, like any executable, it can potentially be flagged by antivirus software if it becomes corrupted or if malware disguises itself under the same filename. Users may encounter errors related to coreftp.exe, such as issues launching the application, connectivity problems during file transfers, or conflicts with firewall settings, which can often be resolved through troubleshooting steps or by ensuring that the software is updated to the latest version. Overall, while coreftp.exe itself is not inherently malicious, users should always exercise caution by downloading software from official sources and maintaining updated security measures on their systems.
